        <!--<h1 align="center">Welcome to Eddie's place!!</h1-->
<h2 align="center"> OUR HISTORY</h2>
<p>In 2007, a young girl had some problems with customer service at a 
    restaurant during her birthday lunch; but she knew there was always a better way out. 
    Coupled with her passion for cooking and hospitality, 
    she decided to cater for the food needs of people in a better way and this resulted in Eddie's Palace. 
    The name is derived from the owners - Edwina and Edwin - of this company.
    Currently, Eddie's Palace takes orders for events and personal reasons.
